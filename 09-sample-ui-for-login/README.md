The LoginKit can be pulled into your app to prompt the user for credentials and then use those credentials to open a synced Realm. User credentials are required to open a synced realm although they could be hardcoded into your app if your app does not require users to log in.

## Features
Light & dark themes for light apps like Realm Draw, and dark apps like Realm Tasks.
Fully adaptive to both smartphone, and tablet screen sizes.
Easy swapping between 'log in' and 'sign up' modes.
Optional settings to hide the server URL and 'remember me' form fields.
The ability to remember username and passwords on subsequent app launches.

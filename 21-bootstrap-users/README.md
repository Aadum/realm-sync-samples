# Realm Object Server Customization Samples

If you're looking to __integrate__ Realm Object Server with your existing infrastructure look no further!
This repo contains code samples for ways you can customize Realm Object Server 2.x with __custom authentication__ and __custom services!__

*Note: we intend to update this sample for the newest version of ROS.  If you experience issues, please reach out to us via our support channel*

1. `git clone` this repo
2. `cd` into the sample that you want

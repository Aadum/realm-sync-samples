# 08. Convert a local Realm to a Synced Realm

## Languages 
- Objective-C
- Node.js 

## Overview

As your application grows to take advantage of more Realm features, you may add synchronization backed by the Realm Object Server---and this may require converting a locally-stored Realm file to a synchronized Realm. While the Realm Platform doesn't offer an automatic solution to this, it doesn't require a lot of code to accomplish. Theses example are for small applications to perform this task; the code could be easily integrated into an existing application.


Currently, Javascript is the recommended language to perform this migration. We aim to have more code samples available in the future. If you are experiencing issues, please submit a ticket [here](https://support.realm.io/).

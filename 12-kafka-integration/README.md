# 12. Integrate with a Kafka Message Queue

The aim of this exercise is to create a basic test application that follows the dequeuer architecture pattern for the Realm Platform. Upon completion, you will be able to write a message to Apache Kafka, consume the message via node.js, and respond to this consumed message by creating a new object in the Realm Object Server.

You can follow along with this guide via the instructions at https://docs.realm.io/platform/guides/integrate-with-a-message-queue

## Typescript Consumer

We have also developed a slightly more sophisticated version of the consumer using typescript.  You'll find the code in ts-consumer.ts 
You will need the necessary typescript dependencies to utilize this version/  

## UPDATE: 
The Realm team is in the process of creating a pre-built Kafka Connector.  If you're looking for more details or access, please shoot us an email at info@realm.io

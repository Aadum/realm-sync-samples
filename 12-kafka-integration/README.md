# 12. Integrate with a Kafka Message Queue

The aim of this exercise is to create a basic test application that follows the dequeuer architecture pattern for the Realm Platform. Upon completion, you will be able to write a message to Apache Kafka, consume the message via node.js, and respond to this consumed message by creating a new object in the Realm Object Server.
